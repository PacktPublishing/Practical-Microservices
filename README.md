# Practical Microservices
This is the code repository for [Practical Microservices](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/practical-microservices?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785885082), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
A microservice architecture helps you build your application as a suite of different services. This approach has been widely adopted as it helps to easily scale up your application with reduced dependencies. This way if a part of your application is corrupted, it can be fixed easily thereby eliminating the possibility of completely shutting down your software. This book will teach you how to leverage Java to build scalable microservices. You will learn the fundamentals of this architecture and how to efficiently implement it practically.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableZuulProxy
public class ApiGatewayExampleInSpring
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        SpringApplication.run(ApiGatewayExampleInSpring.class, args);
    }
}
```

To run examples given in this book, it is recommended that you have a Linux-flavored operating system. You can use Windows or Mac-based systems as well, but the steps described here to install any particular software are explained, keeping the Linux-based system in mind. Other than that, you need to have Maven, Java 8, and any Java-based IDE. It can be Eclipse, IntelliJ, or STS. For the database side, the MySQL community version is recommended.
